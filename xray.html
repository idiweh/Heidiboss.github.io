									<h1>X-Ray Game<br /></h1>
									<p>The X-Ray Game is an educational game made for the radiology department of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The game is currently being tested by the first year radiology students. 
										The game is made together with my classmate Tino Kankkunen (<a href="#">@kysytinonsivu</a>). </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rtg5.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The game was developed as an answer to the lack of training possibilities of the radiology students. There is only one X-ray machine on campus and several classes full of students wanting to practice taking the x-rays.
									The project was asked of us as a product supporting the thesis of three radiology students. Because the game is made for educational use, it was developed using the official standards of Helsinki University Hospital (HUS, Helsingin ja Uudenmaan sairaanhoitopiiri).
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rtg7.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The main goal of the game is to practice cropping the x-ray image correctly, so that the picture matches the official criteria. The controls of the machine are made to replicate the real movement of x-ray machine as good as it is possible 
									using just a computer. As a further developement idea it would be nice to develop the game in VR.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rtg1.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The game begins with three different kinds of written tests that are based on the educational material that we were provided.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rtg2.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>After the player passes the tests, they can continue to a tutorial that walks them through the x-ray rooms.
									The game environment, as in the computer room and x-ray room are 3D modelled by us, based on the rooms they have on radiology campus.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rtg3.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p> After the tutorial the game itself is divided into six levels. Each level consists
									of 2 to 3 different orientations to take x-rays of. When the player passes a level, they can move to the next. 
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rtg4.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The patient (or "the Smurf" as we called it) was purchased by our university from Turbosquid.com, so it had limited movement on the outer mesh. Luckily my knowledge of human anatomy from my profession as physiotherapist and the
									good mobility of the assets bone structure helped us to modify the patient to the officially accepted positions. This phase took quite a while, because it was very spesific what has to be seen on the x-ray and what not.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rtg6.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As a conclusion we and the clients were really satisfied what we were able to make in about 2,5 month project period. If the game would be developed further it would be easy to add more x-ray levels and positions. </p>
