									<h1>Chicken Madness<br /></h1>
									<p>Old nuclear factory upstream from a small farm has polluted the drinking water of the chickens!<br />
									Dodging the enraged chickens, the farmer needs to think of a way to save them,<br />
									before he will be chickenfood himself...<br />

								<p>The Chicken Madness was made as a solo school project to be a full from start to finish playable game. In the assignment we had 7 games from different genres, and I choose a top down shooter.
									Instead of a traditional top down shooter where you just shoot everything coming towards you as efficently as possible, I wanted to make something more original. That produced the idea, that
									the farmer does not want to kill his beloved chickens, but to shoot them with sedation darts to pacify the enraged chickens. Of course overdozing the chickens with the sedation will be fatal,
									and the player will lose points.
								</p>

								<p>As much as I love 3D modelling and world creating, on this game I had to concentrate more on coding efficiently. All assets excluding the chicken models and the player character are from Unity asset
									store. Because the chickens are in central role in the game, I wanted to model and animate it myself. The chickens have a pathfinding system targeted on the player and a state machine to control their
									behaviour. The state machine includes searching, chasing, attacking and sedated states.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/levelend.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The game counts how many chickens the player can save and in the eng gives a total number. There are also different edibles you can pick up, that currently boost either movement speed, heal or grow the
									maximum ammo amount. 
								</p>
								<div class="image right"><img src="images/kana4.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As a first full game I have made by myself I have a lot to be happy about and a lot to develop further. To start with the positive ones: I like how the state machine works, the counting of the saved chickens
									works, the player can pick up different boosters, and there is an easy way to randomize the attacking chickens. Eventually in the given timeframe I did not have time to make different chickens. I would also
									have wanted to make a "Henhouse"-state for the chickens with an objective for the player to pick up the sedated chickens and carry them to the safety of henhouse.
